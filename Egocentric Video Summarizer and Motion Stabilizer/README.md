# This folder contains files to a project for the class of Multimedia Systems Design at USC (Spring 2016).

# The project has multiple executables.

# MyImageLib.py is the common module holder that is to be imported for general functionality.

# sound.py is a starter file for audio playback.

# video.py is a media player with play, pause, fast forward, rewind and stop functionality. It takes the paths of the video file and the audio file as command line inputs.

# summary.py and summary(1).py are files for video summarization using frame difference entropy segmentation. Both summarize ego-centric videos down to a 90 second clip.

# video_stabilization.py is a video stabilizer that works on the principles of smoothening out the Lucas-Kanade optical flow trajectory.

# finding_corners.py is to detect Shi Tomasi corners in the video to estimate the optical flow.

# cythontest.py and gputest.py are starter codes for testing out cython and gpu implementations.
